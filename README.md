The file "pglib_opf_case30_ieee_mod.m" is a modified version of the 30 bus case from the power grid library (https://github.com/power-grid-lib/pglib-opf/blob/master/pglib_opf_case30_ieee.m)
Storage units were added to buses 7 and 12, and the cost2 of generators at buses 1 and 2 was increased from 0 to 0.2

C3E4N00073D1_scenario_303_solution.json was generated using the GOC3 benchmark code (https://github.com/lanl-ansi/GOC3Benchmark.jl)
